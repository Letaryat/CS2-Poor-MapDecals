## Some basic information about texture

Here you can find an example texture that you can just change name of it, change texture and it should work with the plugin after you compile it and upload to steam workshop.
Remember to have:
- Resolution of that texture to be 2 to the power of n (for example 64x64, 128x128, 512x512, 1024x1024, 2048x2048)
- To be rotated the same as exampleTexture.png

.png and .vmat need to be placed in materials/

(I wanted to figure it out so the png would be straight but it bugged so I gave up.)
